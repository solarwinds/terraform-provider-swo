# swo_alert (Resource)

A Terraform resource for managing alerts.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "swo_alert" "https_response_time" {
  name        = "High HTTPS Response Time"
  description = "A high response time has been identified."
  severity    = "INFO"
  enabled     = true
  conditions = [
    {
      metric_name      = "synthetics.https.response.time"
      threshold        = ">=3000"
      duration         = "5m"
      aggregation_type = "AVG"
      target_entity_types = [
        "Website"
      ]
      entity_ids = [
        "e-1521946194448543744",
        "e-1521947552186691584"
      ]
      include_tags = [
        {
          name = "probe.city"
          values : [
            "Tokyo",
            "New York"
          ]
        }
      ],
      exclude_tags = []
    },

## Schema

### Required

- `conditions` (Attributes Set) One or more conditions that must be met to trigger the alert. These conditions are evaluated as a logical AND. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--conditions))
- `name` (String) Alert name.
- `notifications` (List of String) A list of notifications that should be triggered for this alert.
- `severity` (String) Alert severity. Valid values are [`INFO`|`WARNING`|`CRITICAL`].

### Optional

- `description` (String) Alert description.
- `enabled` (Boolean) True if the Alert should be evaluated. Default is `true`.
- `trigger_reset_actions` (Boolean) True if a notification should be sent when an active alert returns to normal. Default is false. Default is `false`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The Id of the resource provided by the backend.

<a id="nestedatt--conditions"></a>
### Nested Schema for `conditions`

Required:

- `aggregation_type` (String) The aggregation function that will be applied to the metric. Valid values are [`AVG`|`COUNT`|`LAST`|`MAX`|`MIN`|`SUM`].
- `duration` (String) How long the threshold has been met before triggering an alert.
- `metric_name` (String) The field name of the metric to be filtered on.
- `target_entity_types` (List of String) The entity types that the alert will be applied to.
- `threshold` (String) Operator and value that represent the threshold of an the alert. When the threshold is breached it triggers the alert. For Operator - binaryOperator:(=|!=|>|<|>=|<=), logicalOperator:(AND|OR) E.g. '>=10'

Optional:

- `entity_ids` (List of String) A list of Entity IDs that will be used to filter on the alert. The alert will only trigger if the alert matches one or more of the entity IDs.
- `exclude_tags` (Attributes Set) Tag key and values to match in order to not trigger an alert. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--conditions--exclude_tags))
- `include_tags` (Attributes Set) Tag key and values to match in order to trigger an alert. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--conditions--include_tags))

<a id="nestedatt--conditions--exclude_tags"></a>
### Nested Schema for `conditions.exclude_tags`

Optional:

- `name` (String) Tag key to match.
- `values` (List of String) Values to match.


<a id="nestedatt--conditions--include_tags"></a>
### Nested Schema for `conditions.include_tags`

Optional:

- `name` (String) Tag key to match.
- `values` (List of String) Values to match.
