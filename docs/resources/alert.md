# swo_alert (Resource)

A Terraform resource for managing alerts.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "swo_alert" "https_response_time" {
  name        = "High HTTPS Response Time"
  description = "A high response time has been identified."
  severity    = "INFO"
  enabled     = true
  notification_actions = [
    {
      configuration_ids       = ["4661:email", "8112:webhook", "2456:newrelic"]
      resend_interval_seconds = 600
    },
  ]
  conditions = [
    {
      metric_name      = "synthetics.https.response.time"
      not_reporting    = false
      threshold        = ">=3000"
      duration         = "5m"
      aggregation_type = "AVG"
      target_entity_types = [
        "Website"
      ]
      entity_ids = [

## Schema

### Required

- `conditions` (Attributes Set) One or more conditions that must be met to trigger the alert. These conditions are evaluated as a logical AND. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--conditions))
- `name` (String) Alert name.
- `severity` (String) Alert severity. Valid values are [`INFO`|`WARNING`|`CRITICAL`].

### Optional

- `description` (String) Alert description.
- `enabled` (Boolean) True if the Alert should be evaluated. Default is `true`.
- `notification_actions` (Attributes Set) List of alert notifications that are sent when an alert triggers. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--notification_actions))
- `notifications` (List of String, Deprecated) A list of notifications that should be triggered for this alert.
- `runbook_link` (String) A runbook is documentation of what steps to follow when something goes wrong.
- `trigger_delay_seconds` (Number) Trigger the alert after the alert condition persists for a specific duration. This prevents false positives. Value must be between 60 and 86400 seconds, and value has to be divisible by 60. Default is `0`.
- `trigger_reset_actions` (Boolean) True if a notification should be sent when an active alert returns to normal. Default is false. Default is `false`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The Id of the resource provided by the backend.

<a id="nestedatt--conditions"></a>
### Nested Schema for `conditions`

Required:

- `aggregation_type` (String) The aggregation function that will be applied to the metric. Valid values are [`AVG`|`COUNT`|`LAST`|`MAX`|`MIN`|`SUM`].
- `duration` (String) The duration window determines how frequently the alert is evaluated.
- `metric_name` (String) The field name of the metric to be filtered on.
- `target_entity_types` (List of String) The entity types that the alert will be applied to. Must match across all alert conditions.
- `threshold` (String) Operator and value that represent the threshold of an the alert. When the threshold is breached it triggers the alert. For Operator - binaryOperator:(=|!=|>|<|>=|<=), logicalOperator:(AND|OR) E.g. '>=10'

Optional:

- `entity_ids` (List of String) A list of Entity IDs that will be used to filter on the alert. The alert will only trigger if the alert matches one or more of the entity IDs. Must match across all alert conditions.
- `exclude_tags` (Attributes Set) Tag key and values to match in order to not trigger an alert. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--conditions--exclude_tags))
- `group_by_metric_tag` (List of String) Group alert data for selected attribute. Must match across all alert conditions.
- `include_tags` (Attributes Set) Tag key and values to match in order to trigger an alert. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--conditions--include_tags))
- `not_reporting` (Boolean) True if the alert should trigger when the metric is not reporting. If true, threshold must be '' and aggregation_type must be 'COUNT'. Default is `false`.
- `query_search` (String) Case-sensitive. System will automatically match existing and newly added entities matching the following query string.

### Nested Schema for `conditions.exclude_tags`

Optional:

- `name` (String) Tag key to match.
- `values` (List of String) Values to match.

### Nested Schema for `notification_actions`

Required:

- `configuration_ids` (List of String) List of configuration_ids in `id:type` format. Example: `["4661:email", "8112:webhook", "2456:newrelic"]`. Valid `type` values are [`email`|`amazonsns`|`msteams`|`newrelic`|`opsgenie`|`pagerduty`|`pushover`|`servicenow`|`slack`|`webhook`|`zapier`|`swsd`].

Optional:

- `resend_interval_seconds` (Number) How often should the notification be resent in case alert keeps being triggered. Null means notification is sent only once. Valid values are 60, 600, 3600, 86400.
