  description = "A high response time has been identified."
  severity    = "INFO"
  enabled     = true
  conditions = [
    {
      metric_name      = "synthetics.https.response.time"
      threshold        = ">=3000"
      duration         = "5m"
      aggregation_type = "AVG"
      type             = "ENTITY_METRIC"
      target_entity_types = [
        "Website"
      ]
      entity_ids = [
        "e-1521946194448543744",

- `notification_type` (String) The type of notification service this alert will notify. (e.g email, slack)
- `notifications` (List of Number) A list of notification configuration IDs to publish to when this alert is triggered.
- `severity` (String) Alert definition severity (INFO|WARNING|CRITICAL).

### Optional

- `description` (String) Alert definition description. (Optional)
- `enabled` (Boolean) Enabled whether Alert definition shall be evaluated. Default is true. (Optional)
